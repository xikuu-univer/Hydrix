# Hydrix
Hydrix is one of the most powerful and beginner-friendly programming languages. It is designed in a way that makes it very easy for new programmers to learn and start coding. Hydrix can be applied in multiple fields such as website development, web applications, data analysis, data science, and more.

This language is built by combining the core concepts of Python, C++, C, and Java, forming a unique beginner-friendly structure. Its main feature is the function keyword-based design, which makes the syntax simple and understandable for beginners.

Hydrix is being developed by Univer LLC and is a closed-source language. The code can only be executed through the Hydrix Engine, and it is not compatible with external compilers or interpreters. This makes Hydrix a fully unique ecosystem that runs entirely on its own engine.

# Official Release

Since Hydrix is a closed-source language and can only be executed using the Hydrix Engine, developers will need the Hydrix Engine to write and run Hydrix code.

Currently, the Hydrix Engine has not yet been officially released to the public, and no official public release date has been confirmed. Until now, Hydrix Engine and the language itself have only been used internally at Univer LLC.

However, Univer LLC has officially announced that the Hydrix Engine and Hydrix Language will be released to the public very soon. Once released, developers and beginners worldwide will be able to access and experience Hydrix.

# Installation

Hydrix is a closed-source language, which means that to use it, you must have the Hydrix Engine. It does not support any other platform or editor, such as VS Code, Replit, or any other IDE.

Below, in the Release section, you will find the download links for Hydrix Engine for Windows and Android.
